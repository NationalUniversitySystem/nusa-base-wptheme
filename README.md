# NUSA WP Base Theme

This repo is a base theme for starting projects by our Web Dev team. It includes industry and team folder and file structure.

When starting a project you ***must*** replace any instances of `NUSA`, `nusa`, etc inside the theme to reflect the project at hand.

---

## Features:
- Gulp setup
- `src` folder is where your SASS/SCSS and JS file development should occur
- `assets` folder and it's contents are generated by the gulp setup
- Override the project URL by creating a file in the root of the theme `gulp.config.local.js` with an object containing your local `projectURL`

---

## Must includes:
- Gulp file setup
- Basic theme setup in `./inc/class-nusa-theme-setup`
- ESLint and SASSLint rules are based on our team and industry standards, do not change these.

---

## Can be removed/deleted or changed:
- Widgets setup inside the theme. The files present are here as an example.
- Customizer setup. The project might not call for it, but again the files are here as example.

---

## Things you might think are missing but are not:
- **Image optimization in Gulp**: This should be done manually because you do not always want to apply the exact same optimization to all images. Refer to [our dev tools](https://github.com/NationalUniversitySystem/nusa-dev-tools#image-compression) for options.

---

## Notes
- It is recommended not to clone this repo. Any `git pull` will mess up your files so download this instead.

## TODO
- Bash or other type of script to replace `NUSA`, `nusa`, etc in the theme.
