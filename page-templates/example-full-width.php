/**
 * Template Name: Full-width Layout
 * Template Post Type: post, page, custom-post-type-slug
 *
 * This is here as an example for building out your page template files.
 * Avoid using the following prefixes:
 * - "template-"
 *   -- WordPress will add this to the body class and will end up doubling up ( e.g. template-template-full-width ).
 * - "page-"
 *   -— WordPress will interpret the file as a specialized template, meant to apply to only one page on your site
 *   -- This only applies if the page template is in the theme's root
 *   -- i.e. why this file is in the "page-templates" folder
 *   -- Avoiding this prefix is still good practice to avoid confusion and because the template might be expanded to support other post types.
